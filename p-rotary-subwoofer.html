                                <h3>Subwoofer</h3>

                                <img src="images/subwoofer/woofer2.jpg" class="image right" width="25%">

                                A rotary subwoofer is a fascinating type of subwoofer: it is a fan that can change the
                                pitch of the blades very quickly. By switching the direction of airflow back and forth
                                very quickly it can generate sound waves.
                                I've always wanted to build one just to hear what such deep bass sounds like, so I built
                                one while taking a course on Acoustics.
                                <br> <br>
                                <p>The picture to the right shows the subwoofer placed in the opening of a window, with
                                    plywood around it to make it as airtight as possible. This turns the entire house
                                    into the enclosure.</p>

                                    <br><br>
                                <h3>Design </h3>


                                <img src="images/subwoofer/Render.png" class="image right" width="30%">

                                <p>The CAD design can be seen on the right. I used an old fan motor to make the
                                    subwoofer rotate, and to module the blade pitch I used the voice coil of an old
                                    subwoofer.

                                    The modulation mechanism consists of two discs that can move with respect to each
                                    other. The blades are connected to one of the discs via some tiny bearings.

                                    The other disc is connected to the blades via small rods that push and pull the
                                    blades. The voice coil moves this second disc, and thus changes the pitch of the
                                    blades.

                                    All the black parts are 3D printed and the blades were laser cut from some very thin
                                    plywood. After building it it looks as follows:</p>

                                <h3>Background</h3>

                                <p>

                                    A traditional speaker setup consists of speakers for the higher frequency range and
                                    a subwoofer
                                    for the lower frequency range. The higher frequency range is covered quite well by
                                    the
                                    midrange speakers and tweeters. However, the lower frequency range is not fully
                                    covered by
                                    a traditional subwoofer. The response of most subwoofers already rolls off above
                                    20Hz, and
                                    most subwoofers certainly do not cover the infrasonic range (f < 20Hz). </p>
                                        <p>
                                            A rotary subwoofer can solve this gap in frequency response. It can generate
                                            very low
                                            frequencies and can even go down to 0Hz, which is no useful sound but is
                                            just constant
                                            displacement of air. Whereas the limitation of traditional conus-based
                                            subwoofers is a lower
                                            frequency limit, the limiting factor for a rotary subwoofer is actually an
                                            upper frequency limit.
