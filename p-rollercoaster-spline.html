                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                                    <p>In order to do some testing for my model roller coaster I need some simple rail sections. For this, I need to be able to get the splines of the rails and spine with control over the banking.
                                        This would be possible with something like NoLimits 2, but it required the professional version which is quite expensive for some simple tests. So I decided to write a Python script that takes in a spline and banking information
                                        very easily from Blender and converts it to the required rail and spine splines. This can then be imported into Fusion 360 for actually making the 3D model.
                                        It starts with a cubic Bezier spline in blender:</p>

                                    <p>A Blender Python script automatically exports all its control points and tilts. This exported data is then processed by the main script that generates the remaning splines. 
                                        It interpolates the Bezier spline with an algorithm that solves for equidistant points on the spline. It finds the normals and binormals to the spline at these points and applies the correct
                                    banking based on the input. Using these vectors, the points that describe the rail and spine splines are easy to find. The result is as follows:</p>

                                    <p>These splines can be imported into Fusion 360:</p>

                                    <p>And finally, it can be converted to a 3D model. The rails, spine and crossties are generated automatically by a script in Fusion 360. The supports are modelled by hand.</p>
