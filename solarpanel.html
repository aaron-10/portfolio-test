                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    During my year at Solar Boat Twente, we built a new hull, and for this we needed a new solar deck. Of course we wanted to have a very lightweight, high efficiency deck.
                    The best option for this is to fabricate custom solar panels, so we can use very high performance cells, and make sure that the lamination is as light as possible.

                <h2>Soldering</h2>
                <p>
                    Soldering the cells took the longest. We make a simple jig from a lasercut piece of wood that fits 3D printed spacers. This made it a lot easier to align the cells
                    and keep them in place while soldering. We placed small weights on the back of the cells to keep them from sliding out of the jig. We had to create 27 panels in total, with
                    16 cells per panel. It took us around a week of non stop soldering to get all the tabs and bypass diodes in there.

                    The panels did turn out very nice though. We only need 24 for our boat, but we made three extra panels as spares. It is very easy to damage
                    the cells during soldering. I you handle them with bit to much force they already crack. After soldering we can test all the panels and select 
                    those with the highest performance.

                <h2>Laminating</h2>
                <p>
                    The next step was to laminate the panels, which we did at a partner company. It involves adding a back sheet, middle glue layers, and a front sheet and placing
                    this sandwich in a big vaccuum oven to seal the layers together.

                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>After the panels were laminated, they were a lot less fragile so we could go on to inspecting them using electroluminescence imaging.
                    This basically means forcing a current through the panels and taking pictures of how they light up in the IR spectrum. We removed the IR filter
                    of an old webcam so we can see the light and made a picture of each panel in a dark room.

                    The EL measurements resulted in a nice overview of the quality of the panels, so we could select the best panels to install on the boat. We put the best panels on the boat where
                        we expect to see the least shadow and the least risk of damage, so far away from the pilot and the edges of the boat. The other panels fill up the rest of the deck, and 
                        we kept the three worst panels as spares.

                <h2>Installing</h2>
                <p>Now that we now what panels should go where, it was time to install them on the boat. We installed them in groups
                    of three panels in series, with one maximum power point tracker per set of three panels. Once again, the layout
                    was optimized to minimize the impact of shadow or potential future damage to the panels. We attached them to the deck
                    using a super strong adhesive. The cables run under the panels and all enter the boat through the same hole, because 
                    of course we don't want a lot of holes in the deck.

                    We placed some weights on the panels after carefully aligning them, such that they stay in place while the adhesive dries.
