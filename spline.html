                <h2>Simple track sections</h2>
                <p> In order to do some testing for my model roller coaster I need some simple rail sections. For this,
                    I
                    need to be able to get the splines of the rails and spine with control over the banking.
                    This would be possible with something like NoLimits 2, but it requires the pro version
                    which is quite expensive for some simple tests. So I decided to write a Python script that takes in
                    a spline and banking information
                    very easily from Blender and converts it to the required rail and spine splines. This can then be
                    imported into Fusion 360 for actually making the 3D model. In the future when I want to actually
                    design a whole coaster, this script can be replaced by NoLimits 2.

                <p>A Blender Python script automatically exports all its control points and tilts. This exported data is
                    then processed by the main script that generates the remaning splines.
                    It interpolates the Bezier spline with an algorithm that solves for equidistant points on the
                    spline. It finds the normals and binormals to the spline at these points and applies the correct
                    banking based on the input. Using these vectors, the points that describe the rail and spine splines
                    are easy to find. The result is as follows:</p>

                <p>Now the splines can be generated, but they still need to be converted to an actual 3D model.
                    Sweeping the rails and spine over the spines is easy, but the crossties are a very tedious
                    to add by hand. Especially once I scale it up to designing a whole coaster with output splines from NoLimits 2 
                    at some point in the future. There needs to be a cutout for the crossties at set intervals along the curve
                    (at each control point). This is realized by copying a sketch with the desired cutout profile
                    to a plane that intersects each set of three control points on the curve.

                <p>Finally, the splines can be converted to a 3D model. The supports are still modelled by hand,
                    as they are a bit more involved than simply copying a cutout along a curve.</p>
