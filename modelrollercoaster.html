                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been wanting to build a model roller coaster for a long time. There is a lot possible with a
                    rather cheap 3D printed (Ender 3) with some small nozzles. At the moment I'm experimenting 
                    with different track, bogie and cart designs, inspired by amazing projects such as the model coasters by <a
                        href="https://www.instagram.com/3d_coasters/">Dan Fritsche</a>.
                    One day I want to build an entire model coaster, but I am trying to get step by step, by first
                    getting all the seperate parts working. At the moment I can already create 3D printed track, but I'm working on
                    <a href="spline.html">automating track generation</a> to make it more feasible to model
                    larger amounts of track.

                <p> The wheel bogies have two main wheels, two side wheels and one upstop wheel, all 
                    containing a tiny 3mm OD bearing.
                    
                    It took quite some iterations to properly finetune the designs of all the tiny parts that need to 
                    fit together perfectly and still move freely.</p>

                <p> The wheels can be 3D printed slowly using a 0.2mm nozzle. The outer surface
                    is nowhere near smooth enough, so by connecting the wheels to the axis of a Dremel,
                    the surface is smoothed using very fine grit sandpaper.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> The remaining parts are also printed with 0.2mm and 0.3mm nozzles, and are design to
                    be press fitted together, only needing a tiny drop of superglue to stay together. The axles
                    are simply made from 1mm steel wire and they are also superglued in place.

                <p>The bogies connect to the carts via a 3mm bolt though a 5mm OD bearing, such 
                    that they can yaw freely. The plan is to connect the carts into a train using 
                universal couplings.</p>

                <p>So far I have only actually built the front cart. The front and back of the cart can 
                    rotate with respect to eachother thanks to a small bearing, which allows the required degree of freedom 
                    for the carts to follow the track. It runs really smoothly on the track, even sideways, upside down and on 
                    a banked track section. The next steps are to realize the rest of the train, and creating more track sections 
                    for testing.
