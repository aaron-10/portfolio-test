                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    A rotary subwoofer is a fascinating type of subwoofer: it is a fan that can change the
                    pitch of the blades very quickly. By switching the direction of airflow back and forth
                    very quickly it can generate sound waves.
                    I've always wanted to build one just to hear what such deep bass sounds like, so I built
                    one while taking a course on Acoustics. For this course I also worked on simulations in COMSOL,
                    but it turns out to be quite tricky to simulate.

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    A traditional speaker setup consists of speakers for the higher frequency range and
                    a subwoofer
                    for the lower frequency range. The higher frequency range is covered quite well by
                    the
                    midrange speakers and tweeters. However, the lower frequency range is not fully
                    covered by
                    a traditional subwoofer. The response of most subwoofers already rolls off above
                    20Hz, and
                    most subwoofers certainly do not cover the infrasonic range (f < 20Hz). </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            A rotary subwoofer can solve this gap in frequency response. It can generate
                            very low
                            frequencies and can even go down to 0Hz, which is no useful sound but is
                            just constant
                            displacement of air. Whereas the limitation of traditional conus-based
                            subwoofers is a lower
                            frequency limit, the limiting factor for a rotary subwoofer is actually an
                            upper frequency limit.

                <p>
                    The modulation mechanism consists of two discs that can move with respect to each
                    other. The blades are connected to one of the discs via some tiny bearings.

                    The other disc is connected to the blades via small rods that push and pull the
                    blades. The voice coil moves this second disc, and thus changes the pitch of the
                    blades.</p>

                <h2>Building</h2>
                <p> I used an old fan motor to make the
                    subwoofer rotate, and to module the blade pitch I used the voice coil of an old
                    subwoofer. All the black parts are 3D printed and the blades were laser cut from some thin
                    plywood.

                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p> The subwoofer can be placed in the opening of a window with
                    plywood around it to make it as airtight as possible. This turns the entire house
                    into the enclosure.</p>

                <p> In the end it worked pretty well. It can even play some music. It got up to a maximum frequency
                    of around 32Hz, but it really struggles at such high frequencies.

                    The sound of the really deep bass is quite unsettling. The frequencies lower than 20Hz are not really audible of course,
                    but you still 'sense' the sound for frequencies slightly lower than 20Hz. Much lower than 20Hz is
                    not detectable. The microphone of my phone could pic it up down to around 12Hz, below which it also
                    stopped detecting the sound.
