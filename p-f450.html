                                <h3>F450 Drone Overview</h3>
                                <p>The F450 drone is a versatile quadcopter frame commonly used for both recreational
                                    and professional drone projects. Known for its durability and modular design, it
                                    provides an excellent platform for learning, experimentation, and aerial
                                    applications.</p>

                                <h3>Flight Controller Integration</h3>
                                <p>The flight controller serves as the brain of the F450 drone, managing stability,
                                    navigation, and overall flight performance. Popular options include the Pixhawk and
                                    the Betaflight series, both offering customizable features to suit different flying
                                    conditions.</p>


                                <h3>Testing and Calibration</h3>
                                <p>Thorough testing is essential to ensure the F450 drone operates safely and
                                    efficiently. Calibration of sensors, such as the IMU and GPS, is critical to
                                    achieving stable flight. Pre-flight checks, including motor alignment, propeller
                                    balance, and battery health, are standard steps before taking off.</p>

                                <h3>Troubleshooting and Optimization</h3>
                                <p>During testing, issues such as oscillations, signal interference, or motor desync may
                                    arise. Tuning PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) settings and reviewing flight
                                    logs help in diagnosing and resolving performance problems. Continuous optimization
                                    ensures smoother flights and better control.</p>
