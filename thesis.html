                <p>
                    For my bachelor thesis, I worked on an adaptive controller for a new type of UAV (Unmanned Aerial
                    Vehicle) with 8 rotors.
                    All the rotors can tilt by the same angle while it is in the air. Depending on the rotor tilt, the
                    feasible forces and torques that the UAV can generate change.
                    The goal of this project was to find out how to make the controller adapt to these changing
                    capabilities such that the controller always uses the capabilities to the greatest possible extent.

                <p>
                    I started by studying a simple 1-dimensional case: a cart on a rails with a tiltable rotor on it.
                    After figuring out how to make the controller adaptive for this simple case, I studied how to apply
                    the results to the UAV.
